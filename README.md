# goPublish
A simple golang kinesis publish client, inspired by BurningMonk's great but poorly named 'Darkseid' (https://github.com/theburningmonk/Darkseid/)

Plan:
* Get simple publish workiing
* Add publishing stats pushed to cloudwatch
* Set up metrics that indicate when a reshard should occur.
** High water mark / throttled threshold
